- The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:  
  \( F(0) = 0 \), \( F(1) = 1 \), and \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n \geq 2 \).  
- The task is to find the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number for a given \( n \) (0 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 30).  
- Example: For \( n = 4 \), \( F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 \).  
- Solutions can be implemented using recursion, iteration, or dynamic programming for efficiency.
